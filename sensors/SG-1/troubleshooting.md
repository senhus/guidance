## Issue 1: Access Point Does Not Show Up in Wi-Fi Page

If the Senhus SG-1C access point does not appear in your Wi-Fi settings, follow these steps:

1. **Sensor Booting for the First Time**:
   - The sensor might take up to 5 minutes to boot for the first time. Please be patient and wait for this duration.
   
2. **Power Source Issues**:
   - Ensure that the cable and power source can deliver 5V. Any good quality power source and USB-C cable should be sufficient.
   - Disconnect and reconnect the cable.
   - Check the back of the sensor for a blinking blue light. If the light is not blinking, there might be an issue with the power source or cable.

# Sensor Placement and Configuration

This guide will help you understand the best practices for placing your SG-1 Human Radar sensor and how to adjust its settings for optimal performance.

## Placement

### General Notes

- **Maximum Detection Range for Moving Persons**: 8 meters
- **Maximum Detection Range for Still Persons**: 8 meters
- Ideally, place the sensor in a location with a clear view. It can detect through non-metal objects such as plastic, glass, ceramic, etc.
- Depending on the sensor's placement, sensitivity adjustments may be necessary.

### Installing on a Wall

- **Ideal Installation Height**: 1 to 1.5 meters
- Ensure the sensor is mounted at this height for the best field of view.
